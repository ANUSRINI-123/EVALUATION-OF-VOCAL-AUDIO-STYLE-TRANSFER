# EVALUATION-OF-VOCAL-AUDIO-STYLE-TRANSFER

We are focusing on the problem of musical style transfer, more specifically changing
a song so that it sounds as if it were sung by another artist. It is relatively
straightforward for humans to distinguish between different artistsâ€™ singing styles,
and many people also enjoy creating covers of songs in their own personal style.
This project focuses on evaluating singing style transfer algorithms to generate
song covers in the style of a specific artist. Our main tool to do this is using a classifier
that classifies existing songs by artist, particularly classifying the singing
component by the singer. This classifier could then be applied to the output of
singing style transfer algorithms to judge their efficacy.
